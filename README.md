## Overview 
**Sentence Similarity**
Sentence Similarity is the task of determining how similar two texts are. Sentence similarity models convert input texts into vectors (embeddings) that capture semantic information and calculate how close (similar) they are between them. This task is particularly useful for information retrieval and clustering/grouping.


**Semantic Textual Similarity**
Semantic Textual Similarity is the task of evaluating how similar two texts are in terms of meaning. 
These models take a source sentence and a list of sentences in which we will look for similarities and will return a list of similarity scores
